### **_Description_**

#### SpotCheck is an app that documents NYC street spots for skateboarders.  A street spot is typically a piece of infrastructure/architecture that is not designed for skateboarding but has certain features that are conducive for skating.  This takes creativity and attention to detail when reading the environment for street spots.  Typically street spots are spread through word of mouth and the spots are given a nickname.  This app will help document newly made/found skate spots to help the skate community explore and conquer those spots they saw in their favorite skate videos.  The user will create an account and is able to post, update and delete a spot that they have found.  For example if the spot you found has been "knobbed" using skate stoppers or there has been an increase in security.  You can update your post to let everyone know.  You will also be able to search for skate spots by borough.
